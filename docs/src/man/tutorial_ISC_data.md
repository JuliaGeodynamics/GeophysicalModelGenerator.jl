# Plot ISC earthquake data

## Goal
This explains how to load earthquake data obtained from the ISC catalogue.

## Steps
#### 1. Download data
You can get data from the ISC catalogue here:
[http://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/catalogue/](http://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/catalogue/)
The catalogue will give you an on screen CSV output that will then have to be copied to a file of your choice (here we will call it *ISC1.dat*). Do that and start julia from the directory where it was downloaded.

#### 2. Read data into Julia
The main data-file, `ISC1.dat`, has 23 lines of comments (indicated with `#`), after which the data starts. We can use the julia package [https://github.com/JuliaData/CSV.jl](CSV.jl) to read in the data, and tell it that the data is separated by `,`.
```julia-repl
julia> using CSV, GeophysicalModelGenerator
julia> data_file        =   CSV.File("ISC1.dat",datarow=24,header=false,delim=',')
```
As this data contains a lot of information that we are not interested in at the moment and which is given in non-numeric formats (e.g. date, time etc.), we will use our helper function *ParseColumns_CSV_File* to only extract columns with numeric data.
```julia-repl
julia> data        =   ParseColumns_CSV_File(data_file, 14)
julia> lon         = data[:,2];
julia> lat         = data[:,1];
julia> depth       = -1* data[:,3];
julia> magnitude   = data[:,4];
```
Converting this data to a GeoStruct data and to export is to Paraview is then straightforward.
```julia-repl
julia> EQ_Data = GeoData(lon,lat,depth,(Magnitude=magnitude,Depth=depth));
julia> Write_Paraview(EQ_Data, "EQ_ISC", PointsData=true)
```
The result the looks like this (plotted here together with the topography):

In case you are interested: we are employing the `oleron` scientific colormap from [Fabio Crameri's scientific colormap package](https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps/) here.
